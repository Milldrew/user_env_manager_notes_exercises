What should someone know when they are learning a new programming language?

They need to know the data types.
The physical and virtual environment the programming language runs in.
The interfaces that are available to the programming language.

1. Learn the data types and how to coerce data types.
  - examples
    • Coerce a number to a string
    • Coerce a string to a list
    • Coerce a list to an object.
    • List to string
    • object to string
    • Check the data type of a variable
2. Learn the expressions, the operators, loops and conditional statements.
  - examples
    • Equality and inequality
    • Mathematical operators
    • Capitalization
    • Loops: for loop and while loop
    • break statements return statements next and continue.
3. Built in functions learn 5 - 10 useful built in functions for each interface or data type
4. Build basic functions.
  - examples
    • Build a function that uses variables from each scope.
    • Take input from user and print hello user name.
    • print out the even numbers up 100
5. Build larger functions
    • Build a tic tac toe game
    • Build a calculator
6. Complete some difficult algorithms.
    • rot 13
    • rotate a numbers digit on a given access
    • get all the substrings
7. Use the useful interfaces that are available and understand them.
8. Package management and documentation comments testing larger projects.
